## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- [React](https://react.dev/) - JavaScript library
- [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) - CSS framework
- [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/) - for development environment

### What I learned

Loopstudios Landing Page is my first React project. In this project, I use Vite for the development environment. As for the styling, I use Tailwind CSS.

Building Loopstudios Landing page is quite challenging since I require good understading of the fundamentals, such as HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I also need to implement my understanding of React.

The most challenging part of this project is to create a responsive functionalities, such as navigation bar and button. I need to implement React Hook `useState`, `useEffect`, and `useRef` to achieve the expected outcome.

Styling using Tailwind CSS also requires a good attention of details since there are various properties to be implemented in `className`.

### Useful resources

I mostly look up for the official documentation while building the project. The following is a list of the resources:

- [React Documentation](https://react.dev/learn)
- [Vite Documentation](https://vitejs.dev/guide/)
- [Tailwind CSS Documentation](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/installation)
